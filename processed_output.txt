PROJECTS  
1: Student  Shield (Android  App):  
Student Shield is a safety -focused Android app designed to empower unive rsity students by 
providing emergency SOS alerts, incident reporting, and self -defense resources. It ensures quick 
assistance  through  automated  alerts  to contacts  and security  personnel,  promoting  a secure  campus 
environment.  
2: Machine  Learning  & Deep  Learning  Projects:  
Fake  News  Prediction  using  Machine  Learning  with  Python  
 This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning and Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) techniques. It utilizes Python along with key libraries such as NumPy, 
Pandas, NLTK, and Scikit -learn to process textual data and build a classification model . 
Spam  Detection  Using  NLP:  
 Developed a machine learning model to classify messages as spam or not using Natural 
Language Processing (NLP). Applied text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stop 
word  removal,  and TF-IDF vectorization,  using  models  such as Naïve  Bayes  for accurate  spam 
detection.  
Brain  Tumor  Detection:  
 Created  a deep  learning  model  to classify  brain  tumors  using  MRI  scan  images.  Implemented 
Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNN)  with  TensorFlow  and Keras  for image  processing  and 
feature extraction, achieving high accuracy in tumor detection.  
Big Mart  Sales  Price  Prediction:  
 Developed a machine learning model to predict Big Mart sales prices based on product and 
store features. Used regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest) with feature 
engineering and hyper parameter tuning to improve accuracy.  
Mall  Customer  Segmentation:  
 Created a machine learning model for mall customer segmentation using clustering 
techniques. Applied K -Means and hierarchical clustering to analyze  customer spending 
behavior and group them into distinct segments for targeted marketing strategies  
End -to-End  Machine  Learning  Pipeline:  
 Developed  and deployed  machine  learning  models  using  Google  Colab  and transitioned  them 
to VS Code for production.  
 Built  complete  ML pipelines,  including  data  loading,  preprocessing,  model  training,  and 
evaluation.  
 Implemented  hyper  parameter  tuning  and model  optimization  techniques  to improve  
performance.  
 Used  Flask  and Docker  for deploying  models  into  production  environments.
