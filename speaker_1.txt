Hey there! Today we're going to dive into the world of Python programming. We'll be exploring the basics of creating code, functions, and variables. Are you ready to get started?
That's right! Python is a fantastic language to start with. Let's begin with creating our first program. We'll be using VS Code, a special type of text editor that allows us to write and execute code. Can you tell me a bit about what you know about text editors?
Of course! A text editor is a program that allows you to write and edit text, whereas an IDE is a more comprehensive tool that includes a text editor, compiler, and other features. VS Code is a bit of a hybrid, as it has features of both.
We'll start by creating a new file called `hello.py`. In this file, we'll write our first line of code: `print('hello, world')`. Can you guess what this line of code does?
Exactly! The `print` function is a built-in function in Python that outputs its argument to the screen. Now, let's talk about functions. What do you think a function is in the context of programming?
That's absolutely right! Functions are reusable blocks of code that take arguments and perform a specific task. We'll be exploring more about functions later on. For now, let's talk about bugs. Have you ever encountered a bug in your code before?
Exactly! Bugs are an inevitable part of the programming process. The key is to learn from them and use them as an opportunity to improve your code. Now, let's improve our `hello.py` program by adding a variable. Can you tell me what a variable is in programming?
That's right! Variables are a fundamental concept in programming. We'll be using variables to store user input and manipulate it in our program. Let's continue improving our `hello.py` program by adding more features.
