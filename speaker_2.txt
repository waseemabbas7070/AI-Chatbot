Thanks for having me! I've always been fascinated by technology and problem-solving. I started my journey in software engineering and soon discovered my interest in AI and machine learning. I've been working on various projects, from developing safety-focused Android apps to building machine learning models for tasks like fake news prediction and brain tumor detection.
Certainly! As a student myself, I realized that safety is a major concern on campuses. I wanted to create something that could provide quick assistance to students in emergency situations. Student Shield allows users to send SOS alerts to their contacts and security personnel with just a few taps. It also includes features like incident reporting and self-defense resources.
Fake news prediction is a challenging task, but it's an important one. I used a combination of NLP techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization to process textual data. Then, I built a classification model using Scikit-learn's Na√Øve Bayes algorithm. It was a great learning experience, and I'm proud of the accuracy we achieved.
Brain tumor detection is a critical application of deep learning. I used Convolutional Neural Networks with TensorFlow and Keras to classify MRI scan images. The key was to preprocess the images effectively and tune the hyperparameters to achieve high accuracy. It was a complex task, but the results were promising.
In my end-to-end ML pipeline project, I developed and deployed machine learning models using Google Colab and VS Code. I built complete ML pipelines, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. I also implemented hyperparameter tuning and model optimization techniques. Finally, I used Flask and Docker to deploy the models into production environments.
I'm excited about the advancements in NLP and computer vision. As someone who's passionate about building intelligent solutions, I see myself working on projects that combine these areas to create innovative applications. I'm always looking to learn and stay updated with the latest technologies.
