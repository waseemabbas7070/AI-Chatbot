Absolutely! I've been wanting to learn more about Python. I've heard it's a great language for beginners.
Well, I've used text editors before, but I've never really understood the difference between a text editor and an IDE. Can you explain?
That makes sense. So, let's get started with creating our first program. What's the first step?
I think it prints 'hello, world' to the screen, right?
I think a function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Is that right?
Yeah, it's happened to me before. It's frustrating, but it's also a great learning opportunity, right?
A variable is a container that holds a value. We can use it to store and manipulate data in our program.
